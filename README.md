# c-2nd-lang-asst-01
First programming assignment for learning C as a second programming language

Notes:
Pointers, esp. passing them around as arguments and return values.
Array-pointer duality.
Useful functions, esp. sensible encapsulation & meaningful contracts (e.g. who initializes array arguments).
Structures.
Compare encapsulation (e.g. for sorting algorithms).
Dynamic memory allocation & correct size calculations.
